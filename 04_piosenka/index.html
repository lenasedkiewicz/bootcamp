            <p>She came to me one morning<br>
                One lonely Sunday morning<br>
                Her long hair flowing<br>
                In the midwinter wind.<br>
                I know not how she found me<br>
                For in darkness I was walking<br>
                And destruction lay around me<br>
                From a fight I could not win</p>
            <p>She asked me name my foe then<br>
                I said the need within some men<br>
                To fight and kill their brothers<br>
                Without thought of love or God<br>
                And I begged her, give me horses<br>
                To trample down my enemies<br>
                So eager was my passion<br>
                To devour this waste of life</p>
            <p>But she wouldn't think of battle that<br>
                Reduces men to animals<br>
                So easy to begin<br>
                And yet impossible to end<br>
                For she's the mother of all men<br>
                Who counselled me so wisely then<br>
                I feared to walk alone again<br>
                And asked if she would stay</p>
            <p>Oh, lady, lend your hand outright<br>
                And let me rest here at your side<br>
                "Have faith and trust in peace", she said<br>
                And filled my heart with life<br>
                There is no strength in numbers<br>
                Have no such misconception<br>
                But when you need me<br>
                Be assured, I won't be far away</p>
            <p>Thus, having spoke, she turned away<br>
                And though I found no words to say<br>
                I stood and watched until I saw<br>
                Her black coat disappear<br>
                My labour is no easier<br>
                But now I know I'm not alone<br>
                I'll find new heart each time<br>
                I think upon that windy day<br>
                And if one day she comes to you<br>
                Drink deeply from her words so wise<br>
                Take courage from her as your prize<br>
                And say hello from me</p>
